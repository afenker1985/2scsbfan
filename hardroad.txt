We're tenting tonight on the old camp ground;
Give us a song to cheer
Our weary hearts, and a song of home
And friends we loved so dear.

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Many are the hearts that are weary tonight,
Wishing for the war to cease;
Many are the hearts that are looking for the right
To see the dawn of peace.
Tenting tonight, tenting tonight, tenting on the old camp ground. 

We've been tenting tonight on the old camp ground,
Thinking of days gone by,
Of the loved ones at home that gave us the hand,
And the tear that said, &quot;Goodbye!&quot;

<strong>Chorus</strong>

We've been fighting tonight on the old camp ground,
And many are lying near:
Some are dead, and some are dying,
And many are in tears. 

<strong>Chorus</strong>

We are tired of war on the old camp ground;
Many are dead and gone
Of the brave and true who've left their homes,
Others wounded long ago.

<strong>Chorus</strong>





Oh, we'll rally round the flag, boys,
We'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And we'll rally from the hillside,
We'll gather from the plain,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom. 

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
The Union forever,
Hurrah! Boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitor,
And up with the stars;
And we'll rally round the flag, boys,
Rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom. 

We are springin' to the call
Of our brothers gone before,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And we'll fill their vacant ranks with
A million free men more,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

<strong>Chorus</chorus>

We will welcome to our numbers
Of loyal, true, and brave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And, although they may be poor,
Not a man shall be a slave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Springing to the call
From the East and from the West,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom;
And we'll hurl the rebel crew
From the land we love the best,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.








When Johnny comes marching home again,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The boys will cheer, and the men will shout,
And, the ladies, they will all turn out;
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home. 

The old church bell will peal with joy,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
To welcome home our darlin' boy,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The village lads and lassies say
With roses they will strew the way,
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home. 

Get ready for the Jubilee,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give the hero three times three,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The laurel wreath is ready now
To place upon his loyal brow,
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home. 

Let love and friendship on that day,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Their choicest treasures then display,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
And let each one perform some part
To fill with joy the warrior's heart,
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home.

Well, you oughta see my Cindy.
She lives here way down South.
She's so sweet, honey bees,
They swarm around her mouth.

When first I saw my Cindy
A-standing in the door,
Her shoes and stockings in her hand,
And her boots spread 'round the floor.

<strong>Chours:</strong>
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy.
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy.
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy.
I'll marry you some day.

Well, I wish I was an apple
A-hanging on a tree,
And every time my Cindy passed
She'd take a bite a of me;

Or if I was made o' sugar,
Standing in the town,
An'every time my Cindy passed
She'd take some sugar down.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Well, my Cindy got religion.
She had it once before,
But, when she heard my old banjo,
She jumped down on the floor. 

She took me to her parlor,
She cooled me with her fan,
She said I was the prettiest thing
In the shape of a mortal man.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Now, my Cindy is a sweet girl;
My Cindy, she's a peach.
She threw her arms around me,
And she hung on like a leech.

She kissed me and she hugged me;
She called me sugar plum.
She hugged so tight I could hardly breathe—
I thought my time had come!

<strong>Chorus</strong>

If I had a thread and needle,
If I knew how to sew,
I'd sew that gal to my coat tails,
And down the road I'd go.

I want my Cindy, Cindy—
Her lips, her arms, her feet!
I ain't never seen another gal
My Cindy could compete.

<strong>Chorus (x2)</strong>







Well, I come from Alabama, with my banjo on my knee,
And I'm goin' to Louisiana my true love for to see.
Well, it rained all night the day I left;
The weather it was dry;
And the sun so hot, I froze to death.
Susanna, don't you cry!

Chorus:
Oh, Susanna! Don't you cry for me.
I've come from Alabama, with my banjo on my knee. 

When I jumped aboard the telegraph,
And trabbelled down the ribber,
Th' electric fluid magnified,
And killed five hundred chigger.
When the bullgine bust, the horse ran off,
I really thought I'd die.
So I shut my eyes to hold my breath.
Susanna, don't you cry!

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Now, I had a dream de other night,
When ev'rything was still,
And I thought I saw Susanna,
She was runnin' down a hill.
Now de buckwheat cake was in her mouth,
And a tear was in her eye,
So I said, &quot;I'm coming from de South.
Susanna, don't you cry!&quot;

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Now, I soon will be in New Orleans,
And then I'll look around;
When at last I find Susanna,
I will fall upon the ground.
But if I can never find her,
Then I think I'll surely die,
When I'm dead and gone and buried,
Please, Susanna, don't you cry!

<strong>Chorus (x2)</strong>







I wanted much to go to war
And went to be examined.
The surgeon looked me o'er and o'er;
My back and chest he hammered.
Said he, &quot;You're not the man for me,
Your lungs are much affected,
And likewise both your eyes are cock'd,
And otherwise defected.&quot;

<strong.Chorus:</strong>
So, now I'm with the invalids,
And cannot go and fight, sir!
The doctor told me so, you know,
Of course it must be right, sir! 

While I was there, a host of chaps
For reasons were exempted.
Old Pursy, he was laid aside;
To pass he had attempted.
The doctor said, &quot;I do not like
Your corporosity, sir!
You'll breed a famine in the camp
Wherever you might be, sir!&quot;

<strong>Chorus</strong>

There came a fellow, mighty tall,
A knock-kneed overgrowner,
And, oh!, the Doctor said, &quot;I got no time
To take and look you over.&quot;
Next came along a little chap,
Who stood about two foot nothing;
The Doctor said, &quot;You'd better go
And tell your mommy you are comin'!&quot;

<strong>Chorus 2:</strong>
So, now their with the invalids,
And cannot go and fight, sir!
The doctor told 'em so, you know,
Of course it must be right, sir! 

Some had the ticerdolerreou,
Some what they call &quot;brown critters,&quot;
And some were &quot;lank and lazy&quot; too,
And some too &quot;fond of bitters.&quot;
Some had peg legs and one one eye,
Their backs were tall and crooked.
You would have laugh'd till you had died
To see how &quot;cute&quot; they look-ed.

<strong>Chorus 2</strong>







As I was a-lumberin' down de street,
Down de street, down de street,
A handsome gal I chanced to meet,
She was fair to view. 

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight,
Come out tonight, come out tonight.
Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon. 

I asked her if she'd have a talk,
Have a talk, have a talk,
Her feet took up the whole sidewalk
As she stood close to me.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

I asked her if you want to dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance
I thought that I would have a chance
To shake the foot with her.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Oh, I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin',
And her hip kept a-rockin', and her toe kept a-nockin'.
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin',
And we danced by the light of the moon.

<strong>Chorus</strong> 

I wanna make that gal my wife,
Gal my wife, gal my wife,
Then I'd be happy all my life
If I had her with me.

<strong>Chorus</strong>







Say, darkey, hab you seen de massa, wid de muffstash on his face,

<strong>Chorus:</strong>

De darkies get so lonesome libbing in de loghouse on de lawn.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

De obserseer he'll cause us trouble, an' he run us round a spell;

De whip is lost, de han'cuffs are broken, but de massa'll hab his pay;
He's old enough, big enough, shoulda known better den to go an' run away. 

<strong>Chorus (x2)</strong>







We are a band of brothers
And native to the soil,
Fighting for our liberty
With treasure, blood, and toil,
And, when our rights were threatened,
The cry rose near and far:
&quot;Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star!&quot;

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights, hurrah!
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star!

As long as the Union
Was faithful to her trust—
Like friends and like bretheren—,
Kind we were and just;
But now, when Northern treachery
Attempts our rights to mar,
We'll hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star.

<strong>Chorus</strong> 

First gallant South Carolina
Nobly made the stand,
Then came Alabama,
And took her by the hand.
Next quickly Mississippi,
Georgia, Florida
All raised on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star.
 
<strong>Chorus</strong>

Ye men of valor gather around
The banner of the right;
Texas and fair Louisiana
Joined us in the fight.
Davis, our loved president,
And Stephens statesmen are,
Rally behind the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star.

<strong>Chorus</strong> 

And here's to brave Virginia,
The Old Dominion State;
With the young Confederacy,
At length, has linked her fate.
Impelled by her example,
Now other states prepare
To hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Then cheer, boys, cheer!
Raise a joyous shout
For Arkansas and North Carolina
Now have both gone out.
And let another rousing cheer
For Tennessee be given.
The single star of the Bonnie Blue Flag
Has grown to be eleven.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Then here's to our Confederacy,
Strong we are and brave.
Like patriots of old we'll fight
Our heritage to save.
And rather than submit to shame,
To die we would prefer!
So cheer, cheer for that Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star!

<strong>Chorus (x2)</strong>

De time is nebber dreary if a darkey never groans.
De ladies nebber weary with a rattle of de bones.
Den come again Susanna, by de gaslight ob de moon,
We'll tum de old Piano when de banjo's out o' tune. 

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Ring, ring de banjo! How I love that good old song!
Come again my true love! Oh, where you been so long!

Oh, nebber count de bubbles while der's water in de spring.
De darkey hab no troubles when he's got dis song to sing.
De beauties ob creation will nebber lose der charm
While I roam de old plantation wid my true lub on my arm.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Well, once I was so lucky, my massa set me free.
I went to old Kentucky to see what I could see.
I could not go no farder, I turn to massa's door;
I lub him all the harder, I'll go away no more.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Early in de morning ob a lovely summer day,
My massa sent me warning, he like to hear me play.
On de banjo I was tapping; I come with dulcem strain;
My massa fall a napping; he'll never wake again!

(Chorus x3)







Away from Mississippi's vale,
With my ol' hat there for a sail,
I crossed upon a cotton bale
To My Rose of Alabamy. 

<strong>Chorus:</strong>
Oh, brown Rosie!
She's my Rose of Alabamy!
Sweet tobacco posey
Is my Rose of Alabamy. 

I landed on de far sand bank,
I sat upon a hollow plank,
And there I made my banjo twank
For my Rose of Alabamy.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

I said, &quot;Sit down just where you please.&quot;
She crossed my leg, she took her ease.
&quot;It's good to go down on the knees,&quot;
Says Rose of Alabamy.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

The river roll; the cricket sing;
The lightnin' bug he flashed his wing;
Like a rope my arms I fling
'Round Rose of Alabamy.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

I huffed so long I cannot tell,
But Rosie seemed to like it well.
Then my banjo in the river fell.
Oh, Rose of Alabamy!

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Like the alligator after prey,
I plunged in, but it float away.
All the while it seem to say,
&quot;Oh, Rose of Alabamy.&quot;

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Now, every night before o' shower,
We'll hunt that banjo for an hour;
I'll make my sweet tobacco flower,
My Rose of Alabamy.

<strong>Chorus (x2)</strong>
